# Machine-Learning
A very simple python program to implement univariate and multivariate Linear Regression froms scratch.Implementation is as follows:

1. Basic implementation of linear regression 
2. Exploring the effect of different learning rates on convergence (alpha)
3. Data visualization to understand the working of algorithm and other steps
